Include a very brief summary of your project here.
Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)

In this section, document any learning and design activities you complete as a group.

The main responsibility of every team is to ensure that all members would be comfortable implementing the basic functionalities and requirements defined in this document **on their own**. 

This may mean that you allocate less time for features, and more time for team collaboration and learning activities.
Once a team-wide baseline understanding is achieved, team-members are encouraged to use their interests and skillsets to pursue technical and design achievements that enhance the web application's functionality and design.
